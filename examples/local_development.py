Example: Local Development Without Redis

This example demonstrates using Docket with the in-memory backend for
local development, prototyping, or situations where you don't have Redis
available but still want to use Docket's task scheduling features.

Use cases:
- Local development on a laptop without Docker/Redis
- Quick prototyping and experimentation
- Educational/tutorial environments
- Desktop applications that need background tasks
- CI/CD environments without Redis containers
- Single-process utilities that benefit from task scheduling

Limitations:
- Single process only (no distributed workers)
- Data stored in memory (lost on restart)
- Performance may differ from real Redis

To run:
    uv run examples/local_development.py
